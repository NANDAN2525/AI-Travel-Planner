Got it âœ… You want me to behave like an **expert prompt designer** and prepare a **Project Requirement Document (PRD)** for your "Personalized Trip Planner with AI" idea, in a structured format that you can use directly inside **Cursor** for AI-assisted development.

Hereâ€™s a well-structured PRD written in a **Cursor-friendly format** (clear prompts, detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, and tech stack instructions).

# ðŸ“„ Project Requirement Document (PRD)

**Project Title**: Personalized Trip Planner with AI

---

## 1. Overview

The **AI-Powered Personalized Trip Planner** dynamically creates end-to-end itineraries tailored to individual **budgets, interests, and real-time conditions**, with **seamless booking and payment capabilities**.

It integrates **Google AI technologies** (Gemini, Vertex AI, Maps API) with a **React/Next.js frontend** to deliver a highly interactive, multilingual travel assistant.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Travelers face challenges in planning trips:

* Balancing **budget vs. time vs. interests**.
* Existing platforms provide **generic suggestions**.
* Travelers waste time gathering information across multiple sources.

---

## 3. Objectives

* Build an **AI assistant** that generates **personalized itineraries**.
* Provide **real-time adaptive recommendations**.
* Allow **seamless booking** through EMT inventory.
* Deliver a **final optimized itinerary with cost breakdowns**.
* Enable **one-click payment + booking confirmation**.

* User receives invoice + e-ticket in email & app.

---

### D. Multilingual, Interactive UI

* React/Next.js frontend.
* Firebase for authentication & notifications.
* Support for **English, Hindi, and 1 regional language** initially.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Language toggle available in UI.
* Itinerary translated dynamically without page reload.

---

### E. Data Aggregation

* Sources:

  * Google Maps API (transport, POIs).
  * Events API / Local guides.
  * BigQuery for storing trip data + preferences.
* AI Layer: Gemini / Vertex AI for natural language itinerary generation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Must pull live data for transport & weather.
* Cached responses < 24 hours old for non-time-sensitive data.

---

## 5. Tech Stack

### Frontend

* React + Next.js
* Tailwind CSS for UI
* Firebase (Auth, Notifications, Firestore)

* **Security**:

  * OAuth2 / Firebase Auth.
  * PCI-DSS compliance for payments.
* **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with failover APIs.

---

## 7. Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
